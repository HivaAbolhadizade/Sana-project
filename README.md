# Sana-project
Welcome to the "School Student Information System" project, also known as Sana! This project consists of a website with front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a back-end using Django. With Sana, you can register and manage student information with ease.
This project is a student discipline registration system, designed to help schools manage and track student discipline records.
With Sana, school administrators can easily create, update, and track disciplinary actions taken against students, as well as generate reports on disciplinary activity. The user-friendly interface and intuitive design make it easy to navigate and use the system. Sana is a valuable tool for any educational institution looking to improve their student discipline management process.
